      <h3> What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
        <h4>I believe that i need to relfect on how these tests judged me and try and make corrections in how i act in order to become a better worker</h4>
      <h3> How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team?</h3>
        <h4>I believe my result in the Myers-Briggs test, judging me Turbulent will negatively affect my prospects in a team, and this is something that i need to work on in order to become more assertive in my actions and work with all of my team memebers in order to establish a good work ethic between us</h4>
      <h3> How should you take this into acount when forming a team?</h3>
        <h4>I think that with how the results say i am right now i need to form a team with members who are opposite in areas where i am majorly on one side, so i should try and get someone who is overly assertive in order to try to attempt to make the team dynamic work and function properly, and hopefully this person in the team will try to influence me to become more assertive in my work</h4>

    <u><center><h2>Project ideas</h2></center></u>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
        <h4>This project will be a website that provides widespread access to a new decentralised file sharing technology. This decentralised file sharing technology is known as IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). This technology is open-source, meaning it is available to everyone. It provides a service where files are stored on everyone’s computer, compared to centralised servers. This comes with a few unique benefits, such as; privacy, freedom, and lower network capacity requirements which leads to a faster delivery. The type of content that can be delivered, is any type of file. This includes images, videos, PDF’s, Word, as well as website files, and pretty much anything your computer can store.</h4>
      <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <h4>The motivation for this project is to enhance my web development skills, learn how to run a business, and create a solution to the lack of consumer access to this new technology. Throughout the development of this website, I will learn many skills in relation to setting up a complex website. It will also have the ability to provide a monetary gain, making it a business forming a foundation for my entrepreneurship. It also provides a solution to consumers who want to access this new technology, without having basic knowledge of this newfound technology.</h4>
      <h3>Description</h3>
        <h4>The website, Interplanetary Hub.com is a combination of Google and a forum (like reddit). It allows the sharing of links between users on the website. The interface of the forum is democratic in nature, allowing the content that the user is searching for to be easily accessible. Upon first glance of the website, the user will be presented with a “featured links” section to demonstrate the usefulness of this tool. Under that there will be a search bar where the user can search for the content/file they are looking for.
        Once the user logs in, they will have the ability to post and vote on links, and perhaps even comment. The downvoting system will help solve the issue of users who post “Bad Links”, as we can monitor a post and its reception, and based on this, act against the post. Bad links could be anything from misleading, phishing, broken, or links malicious intent.
        The website will guide users into this new technology, known as IPFS. To access content the user will be required to install 2 things; A browser extension, and a desktop application. If the user does not have these installed, the links will not work. The website will be able to detect if a user does not have these installed and create a pop-up window that notifies them of their mistake and shows them how to easily install the IPFS software. This will remove the learning curve of using IPFS, so users can get straight into the content that they want.
        To monetise the website, there can be multiple sources of revenue. These possible sources are as follow; Advertisements, promoting links, upgraded accounts (i.e. increased functionality), and information can be sold. This income will be used to pay running costs (i.e. Server, Domain registration, Legal Fees, and wages).
        The website’s functionality will evolve over time, according to new ideas and market trends. This will help the website grow into its ideal form of a platform for everyone to share links to content. The business aspect will also help it to grow as it provides the incentive of money. The more money we get, the more hard work happen, the big more money we get! BIG TIME</h4>
      <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
        <h4>The languages that the website will be written in is the standard HTML + CSS for the User Interface. On the backend, the website will use PHP and mySQL to retrieve/store data. Python will also be used in order to complete calculations on what should be featured. On the hardware side Google Cloud Service (GCS) will be used to host the website on a LINUX Ubuntu server. For the development process of the website, code will be stored on GitHub for collaboration within the team working on the website. The website is also based upon IPFS (Interplanetary File System) Technology which the website at its current state does not actually interact with.</h4>
      <h3>Skills Required</h3>
        <h4>The skills required for the creation of this website are minimal compared to a majority of projects within the Web Development community. This is due to the fact that it does not use any frameworks, specifically any JavaScript frameworks, such as; React Node Vue or Angular. As well as a PHP framework like WordPress or Laravel. The unique skills that we must possess for this project include; Moderate understanding of CSS, Extensive knowledge of OOP (Object Orientated Programming) PHP, as well as mySQL database management/interaction, Application deployment on GCS, Moderate business skills, as well as a background knowledge of IPFS Concepts.</h4>
      <h3>Outcome</h3>
        <h4>It will expand the horizon of the average consumers use of IPFS to retrieve content. Through the website’s functionality a platform is provided to users who want to find content on the IPFS network with ease. The impact this development will have is that content distribution will be revolutionised amongst the average consumer. This will be in direct competition with other content delivery services and link providers such as Google, and other search engines. Hopefully this platform can evolve into something universally recognised as the best place to find the content that you’re looking for 😊</h4>
